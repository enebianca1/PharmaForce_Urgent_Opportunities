# Documentation: ONBD-34 - Implement Error Handling and Queueable Apex for Urgent Opportunities

## Objective

The purpose of this task is to enhance error handling for the urgent opportunities functionality .

---

## Key Changes

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Introduced a reusable `ErrorHandler` class to log exceptions into a custom object `ErrorLog__c`.
   - Ensured all errors are captured and logged with detailed information.

2. **Queueable Apex Implementation**:
   - Replaced synchronous opportunity creation with a `Queueable` class.
   - This ensures better scalability and avoids governor limits during heavy operations.

3. **Improved Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Introduced logging for errors and potential success messages.

---

## Technical Details

### Custom Object: `ErrorLog__c`

The `ErrorLog__c` object stores error details for debugging and monitoring.

### Apex Class: `ErrorHandler`

This utility class is responsible for logging errors into the `ErrorLog__c` object.

### Queueable Apex Class: `CreateUrgentOpportunityQueueable`

This class handles the asynchronous creation of urgent opportunities.

### Updated Controller Method: `createOpportunityAsync`

This method enqueues the `Queueable` job to create an urgent opportunity.

## Testing

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Successful Opportunity Creation**:
   - Input: Valid `AccountId`, `Name`, `StageName`, `Amount`, and `CloseDate`.
   - Expected: Opportunity is created successfully.

2. **Failure Case (Missing Required Fields)**:
   - Input: Missing required field `StageName`.
   - Expected: Opportunity creation fails, error is logged in `ErrorLog__c`.

   ## Outcome

1. **Error Logging**:
   - All exceptions are logged in `ErrorLog__c` with detailed information.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Queueable Apex ensures the process can handle large volumes of data without hitting governor limits.

3. **Robustness**:
   - Improved feedback mechanism for error handling and debugging.
